# Code of Conduct

We follow the spirit of the Contributor Covenant (v2.1) to maintain an open, inclusive, harassment‑free community.

## Our Standards
Positive behavior includes:
- Using welcoming, inclusive language
- Active listening & respectful feedback
- Gracefully accepting constructive critique
- Prioritizing community benefit over individual preference

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Doxxing or publishing private information
- Sustained disruption (trolling, derailment)
- Sexualized language or imagery

## Scope
Applies to all project spaces (repository, issues, PRs, discussions, real-time chats) and external representation while acting on behalf of the project.

## Enforcement
Report incidents privately to the maintainers (contact channel to be published). Reports are treated confidentially. The team will:
1. Acknowledge receipt.
2. Review and assess severity.
3. Decide on actions (warning, temporary exclusion, permanent exclusion).
4. Communicate the decision to the reporter (and, where appropriate, the subject) without public disclosure of private details.

## Enforcement Guidelines
- Minor violation: Verbal or written warning.
- Repeated minor / single moderate violation: Temporary ban.
- Severe violation or continued misconduct: Permanent ban.

## Attribution
